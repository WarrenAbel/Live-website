  <h1>Questions &amp; Answers</h1>

  <h2>What kind of files can I upload?</h2>
  <p>
    We accept a range of common design formats used for laser cutting and fabrication:
    DWG, DWT, DXF, DWS, DWF, DWFx, DXB, PDF, STL and common image formats such as JPEG, JPG,
    PNG, TIFF and BMP. If you are not sure whether your file will work, you can attach it
    to a <a href="request-quote.html">quote request</a> or ask us via the
    <a href="ask-question.html">Contact Us</a> page.
  </p>

  <h2>How accurate is the laser cutting?</h2>
  <p>
    Laser cutting is generally very accurate for sheet metal work. For most jobs we work
    to tolerances suitable for general fabrication. If your parts have critical dimensions
    or fits, please clearly indicate this on your drawings or in the comments section of
    the quote form so that we can review and advise.
  </p>

  <h2>Can you bend or form the parts as well?</h2>
  <p>
    Our primary service is laser cutting. If you require bending or additional fabrication,
    please mention it in the comments when requesting a quote or ask us directly. We will
    let you know what is possible based on the specifics of your job.
  </p>

  <h2>Do you supply material, or can I bring my own?</h2>
  <p>
    We normally supply material from our standard range listed on the
    <a href="metals.html">Metals Available</a> page. In some cases we may be able to work
    with customer-supplied material, depending on the grade, thickness and condition.
    Please contact us with details if you would like to provide your own material.
  </p>

  <h2>What is the usual lead time?</h2>
  <p>
    Lead times depend on current workload, material availability and job complexity.
    When we send you a quotation, we will include an estimated lead time. If you have
    a specific deadline, let us know when requesting a quote so that we can confirm
    whether it is achievable.
  </p>

  <h2>How do I get pricing?</h2>
  <p>
    Pricing is calculated per job based on material, thickness, cutting time and any
    additional requirements. To receive pricing, please complete the
    <a href="request-quote.html">Request a Quote</a> form and upload your design file.
  </p>

  <h2>What if I still have questions?</h2>
  <p>
    If your question is not answered here, please use the
    <a href="ask-question.html">Contact Us/Ask a Question</a> page to send us a message.
    We are happy to clarify material choices, thicknesses, file formats or anything else
    related to your job.
