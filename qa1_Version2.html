  <h1>Q &amp; A</h1>

  <h2>Question: What are your tolerances?</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <p>Cutting is normally within 0.25mm.</p>
  <p>
    Bending has many influences - we normally work on +/- 1mm. Critical bending
    tolerance needs to be communicated.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Key Bending Parameters</strong></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Minimum Bend Radius:</strong> This is the smallest possible radius for a bend
    without the material cracking or deforming undesirably.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Soft Materials</strong> like aluminium and mild steel: The minimum bend
      radius is often 1 times the material thickness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Harder Materials</strong> like the other metals listed: A radius of 2 times the
      material thickness or more is generally required to prevent cracking.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>General Rule:</strong> For materials between 2–6 mm thick, a radius of 1x
      thickness is often acceptable; for thicker materials, 2–3x is recommended.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Minimum Flange Length:</strong> This is the shortest possible length of material that
    can be successfully bent on a die.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>General Rule:</strong> A common guideline suggests a minimum flange
      length of 4x the material thickness or 12mm, whichever is greater.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Z-Bends:</strong> A specific minimum X-measurement (distance from the bend to the
    edge) must be maintained to prevent tool collisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Feature Spacing:</strong> Features like holes or other bends need to be placed a
    sufficient distance from bend lines.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>General Rule:</strong> Keep features at least 4 times the material thickness away
      from bend lines to avoid issues during manufacturing.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Curls:</strong> For more complex curls, the spacing from other features should be a
    minimum of the curl radius plus the sheet metal thickness.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Tolerances</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bend Angle Tolerance:</strong> A common tolerance for bend angles is ±1°.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Length Tolerance:</strong> A typical tolerance for bend length is ±0.20mm
      (0.010 inches) per bend.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ISO 2768:</strong> This international standard is a widely recognized reference for
      general tolerances in precision sheet metal manufacturing, encompassing linear,
      angular, and geometric tolerances.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Question: Do you have tips for effective bending?</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Avoid Acute Angles:</strong> Do not design for angles sharper than 130°.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Obtuse Angles:</strong> Do not design for angles greater than 5°.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Be Mindful of Successive Bends:</strong> Place bends as far apart as possible, as
      successive bends can be difficult to fit on the die and can complicate the
      manufacturing process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consider Material Hardness:</strong> The specific material and its yield strength
      are crucial factors in determining appropriate bend radii and overall feasibility.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Question: What metals do you offer?</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <p>If you need something not in this list, please reach out to us.</p>
  <p><strong>Metals we offer:</strong></p>

  <p>
    <strong>Mild Steel:</strong> Mild steel (also called low-carbon steel) is a type of carbon
    steel that contains a relatively low percentage of carbon, typically 0.05% to
    0.25%. Because of this low carbon content, it is ductile, malleable, and
    easy to work with, making it one of the most commonly used forms of steel
    in construction, manufacturing, and fabrication.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3CR12 Stainless Steel:</strong> 3CR12 is a corrosion-resistant stainless steel grade
    that falls within the utility ferritic stainless steels group. It was originally
    developed in South Africa by Columbus Stainless and is known as the
    world’s most commonly used 12% chromium utility stainless steel.
    It bridges the gap between carbon/mild steel and the more expensive
    austenitic stainless steels (like 304 and 316), offering a balance of
    corrosion resistance, strength, and cost-effectiveness.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>430 Stainless Steel:</strong> 430 stainless steel is a straight chromium ferritic
    stainless steel that contains around 16–18% chromium and very little to no
    nickel. It is one of the most widely used ferritic stainless steels, valued for
    its good corrosion resistance, formability, and affordability compared to
    austenitic grades like 304.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>304 Stainless Steel:</strong> 304 stainless steel is the most widely used stainless
    steel grade in the world. It belongs to the austenitic stainless steel family,
    known for its excellent corrosion resistance, durability, and formability.
    Because of its balanced properties and affordability, it is often called the
    “workhorse” of stainless steels.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>316 Stainless Steel:</strong> 316 stainless steel is a premium austenitic stainless
    steel known for its exceptional corrosion resistance, especially in harsh
    environments. It is often called the “marine grade stainless steel” because it
    performs better than 304 in chloride-rich environments such as seawater
    and de-icing salts.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Aluminium 1050:</strong> Aluminium 1050 is a commercially pure aluminium grade
    (at least 99.5% aluminium content) and belongs to the 1xxx series of wrought
    aluminium alloys. It is one of the most commonly used “pure” aluminium
    grades, valued for its excellent corrosion resistance, high ductility, and
    very good thermal and electrical conductivity. It is a non-heat-treatable
    alloy, meaning its strength is achieved through cold working (work
    hardening) rather than heat treatment.
  </p>

  <h2>Question: How do I design a part?</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Refer to the <a href="how-it-works.html">How it works</a> section for some guiding comments.
  </p>
  <p>
    You need to have an idea of the shape of the part you need. You also need to know
    how large it should be. If it needs to fit into a certain space or be a part of a larger
    structure, you need to measure very carefully.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don’t have the skills or the time to produce a CAD model, send us a picture
    or a drawing of what you need, along with the critical dimensions, and thickness
    of the metal you plan to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you need help with advice on how to get to a design to solve your particular
    problem, please get in touch.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are the type of person who likes to learn a new skill or if you want to play
    with the design until you are happy, we recommend that you learn CAD.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many free and paid packages available, some online and some
    that you need to install.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no standard way in which they work, so changing packages often
    requires some time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We like the online packages that allow for easy collaboration and don’t
    require fast or specialised computers or laptops to work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Choose an option that has good online support and communities that
    provide content and forums.
  </p>

  <h2>Question: How do returns work?</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Refer to the <a href="how-it-works.html">How it works</a> section for more detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because we provide custom parts made to order, we can’t accept returns if we
    provide a part as per the approved design and within tolerance.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, if we made a mistake, we will send you a replacement part at no
    additional cost to you.
  </p>

  <h2>Question: What are the different surface finishes?</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Refer to the <a href="metals.html">Metals Available</a> page for which finishes are available for which metals.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Hot rolled:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Surface finish:</strong> Rougher, with scale (oxide layer).</li>
    <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Less precise tolerances (can shrink while cooling).</li>
    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Lower strength than cold rolled steel, but more ductile.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Cheaper to produce because it requires less processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Cold rolled:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Surface finish:</strong> Smooth, clean, often shiny.</li>
    <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Very precise thickness and shape control.</li>
    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Higher tensile strength and hardness due to work hardening.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> More expensive than hot rolled steel because of extra processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Galvanised:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Galvanized steel possesses excellent corrosion resistance due to its zinc coating,
    which acts as a protective barrier and sacrificial layer. It is also durable,
    cost-effective, and low-maintenance, with a long lifespan. Other key properties
    include its strength, weldability, formability, and recyclability.
