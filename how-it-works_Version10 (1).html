  <h1>How It Works</h1>

  <p>
    Bend Cut Send provides laser-cut metal parts based on your own designs. Our process
    is intentionally simple – you send us a drawing, choose the material and finish,
    and we deliver accurately cut parts.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Prepare your design</h2>
  <p>
    Start by preparing a 2D or 3D design of the parts you want to have cut. We accept
    a range of common formats typically exported from CAD software, including DWG,
    DXF, DWT, DWS, DWF, DWFx, DXB, PDF, STL and common image formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP).
    Please ensure that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dimensions are clearly indicated and drawn at 1:1 scale where possible.</li>
    <li>All parts to be cut are visible on the drawing and not hidden by layers.</li>
    <li>Holes and cutouts are sized appropriately for the material thickness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Choose material, finish and thickness</h2>
  <p>
    On the <a href="request-quote.html">Request a Quote</a> page, you will select a material,
    surface finish and thickness combination. These options are limited to combinations
    we can cut reliably. The dropdowns on the form guide you through valid choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are unsure which material or thickness is best for your application, you can
    use the <a href="ask-question.html">Contact Us/Ask a Question</a> page to ask for advice
    before submitting a quote request.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Submit a quote request</h2>
  <p>
    Once your design file is ready and you know the material requirements, complete the
    quote form with your contact details and address. Upload your design file and specify
    the quantity required. You can also add comments if there is anything special we
    should know about your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you submit the form, you will receive an automatic confirmation email summarising
    your request. At the same time, we receive your details and design so that we can
    prepare a quotation.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Receive your quotation</h2>
  <p>
    We will review your design, check the selected material and thickness, and calculate
    cutting time and material usage. If anything is unclear or needs adjustment, we may
    contact you by email to confirm details before finalising the quote.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once ready, we send you a quotation by email. The quotation will include pricing,
    lead time estimates and any notes or recommendations.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Production and delivery</h2>
  <p>
    When you accept the quotation and confirm that you would like to proceed, we schedule
    your job for cutting. Your parts are then laser cut according to your design and
    the agreed material specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    After cutting, your order is packed for delivery. Depending on your location and our
    arrangement with you, we either ship the parts to your address or make them available
    for collection.
  </p>

  <h2>Need help?</h2>

    format is suitable, please send us a message via the
